# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Course Project for the Coursera course titled "Getting and Cleaning Data". The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

#Running the Script
1. Download the data set [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
2. Unzip the downloaded file to `./data`
3. Execute run_analysis.R
4. The script will output `UCI_HAR_Tidy.csv` in the `./data` folder

#Dependencies
The script requires the `reshape2` package, which can be downloaded from CRAN.
